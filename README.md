# Prosper Loan Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of loan data from the Prosper platform. The main goal of this project is to explore the relationship between a borrower's employment status, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of the loan, and the current status of the loan. The analysis provided some valuable insights into the factors that influence the APR of a loan and the current status of the loan. These insights could be useful for both borrowers and investors on the Prosper platform.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing was done using SQL. The raw data was cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for analysis.

## Dashboard
A dashboard was created using Tableau Public to visualize the results of the data analysis. The dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the data and understand the patterns in the data. You can access the interactive dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/ProsperLoan-EmploymentStatus/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). The static version is provided below.
